# Simple Shell Project

## Description
This is a simple Unix shell implementation written in C. The shell supports basic command execution, input/output redirection, and piped commands. It serves as a fundamental introduction to understanding how shells work and how they manage processes.

## Features
- Command execution
- Navigation
- Basic shell commands

## Future Release would support:
- Input/output redirection
- Piped commands

## Getting Started
To compile the shell, use the following command:
`gcc shell.c -o shell`


To run the shell, execute:
`./shell`


## Usage
Once the shell is running, you can execute commands as you would in a regular Unix shell. Basic commands, input/output redirection, and pipes are supported. For example:



- `$ ls -l`
- `$ cat input.txt > output.txt`
